# Plan: Hosting Presentation Slides with GitHub Pages and Reveal.js

## Overview
This project will use GitHub Pages to host interactive presentation slides created with Reveal.js. This approach is widely used for technical and academic presentations.

## Why GitHub Pages?
- Free static site hosting directly from your GitHub repository
- Supports custom domains and HTTPS
- Easy version control and sharing

## Why Reveal.js?
- Open-source HTML presentation framework
- Supports Markdown and HTML slides
- Highly customizable and interactive

## Implementation Steps
1. **Create slides** using Markdown or HTML files in the repository.
2. **Integrate Reveal.js** by linking to the CDN or adding Reveal.js files to the project.
3. **Configure GitHub Pages** to serve the site from the desired branch or folder (e.g., `main`, `gh-pages`, or `/docs`).
4. **Push changes** to GitHub; slides will be automatically published and accessible via a public URL.

## Benefits
- Free and reliable hosting
- Easy to update and maintain
- Shareable URLs for presentations
- Custom domain support

## Limitations
- Only static content (no server-side code)
- Large assets may need optimization
